SOG was a covert unit that conducted unconventional warfare behind enemy lines, often outnumbered and hunted by the enemy. SOG operatives were the elite of the elite, and many of them went on to form the Delta Force.
 
In Elite Warriors: Vietnam, you will take on the role of a SOG team leader, and lead your Green Beret and Montagnard teammates on various missions across Southeast Asia. You will have to use stealth, tactics, and firepower to complete your objectives, such as rescuing downed pilots, ambushing convoys, seizing prisoners, and directing air strikes.
 
The game features eight realistic campaigns that take place in multiple phases, and a team building system that allows you to train and equip your team members. You will also face the challenges of the harsh terrain, weather, and enemy forces, including trackers, bloodhounds, and booby traps.
 
Elite Warriors: Vietnam is a game that combines action, strategy, and historical accuracy. It is based on the books and consultation of Major John L. Plaster, a SOG veteran and one of the most decorated soldiers of the Vietnam War.

One of the most daring and dangerous missions of SOG was to capture enemy prisoners for interrogation and intelligence gathering. These missions, known as Prisoner Snatch or Bright Light, involved infiltrating deep into enemy territory, locating a target of opportunity, and extracting him alive and undetected.
 
These missions required careful planning, precise timing, and flawless execution. The SOG teams had to avoid detection by enemy patrols, sensors, radars, and aircraft. They also had to deal with the hostile terrain, weather, and wildlife. They had to use non-lethal weapons and techniques to subdue their targets, and secure them with ropes, gags, and blindfolds. They had to coordinate with friendly aircraft for extraction, and be ready to fight their way out if compromised.
 
The risks were high, but the rewards were also great. The prisoners captured by SOG provided valuable information on enemy troop movements, supply routes, weapons systems, and future plans. They also helped to demoralize the enemy and boost the morale of the friendly forces. Some of the prisoners even defected and joined the SOG as agents or interpreters.
 
SOG conducted hundreds of prisoner snatch missions throughout the Vietnam War, with varying degrees of success. Some of the most notable ones were Operation Tailwind in Laos in 1970, which resulted in the capture of 12 prisoners and the destruction of an enemy base; Operation Thundercloud in Cambodia in 1971, which netted four prisoners and several documents; and Operation Polar Circle in North Vietnam in 1972, which was the last and most ambitious prisoner snatch mission ever attempted by SOG.
