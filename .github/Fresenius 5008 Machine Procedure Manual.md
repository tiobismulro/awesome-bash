The Fresenius 5008 Hemodialysis System is a device that performs hemodialysis, a treatment that removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood of patients with kidney failure. The system can also perform online hemodiafiltration (HDF), a therapy that combines hemodialysis with convective clearance of solutes using a high-flux dialyzer and a substitution fluid.
 
This article will provide a brief overview of the operating instructions for the Fresenius 5008 Hemodialysis System, based on the manuals available on the manufacturer's website[^1^] [^2^]. For more detailed information, please refer to the original manuals.

## Starting System and Set-Up
 
To start the system, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch on the system by pressing the power button on the front panel.
2. Select "treatment" or "disinfection" on the touch screen.
3. Connect the concentrate and bibagÂ® containers to the corresponding ports on the back of the system. Ensure that the correct concentrate is selected in the dialysate menu.
4. The system will automatically perform a T1 test to check the electrical safety and functionality of the system. Wait until the test is completed.
5. Open the extracorporeal blood module (EBM) doors and follow the on-screen instructions for lining. Connect the arterial line first, ensuring that the sound is generated when inserting the red "alpha clip" into the blood pump. Then connect the venous line, ensuring that the sound is generated when inserting the blue "alpha clip" into the online HDF pump. Close the EBM doors.
6. Connect the dialyzer to the dialysate ports on the front panel. Ensure that the color coding of the dialyzer couplings matches that of the ports.
7. Connect the patient lines to the corresponding ports on the dialyzer. Ensure that there are no kinks or twists in the lines.
8. Press "start" on the touch screen to initiate priming. The system will automatically prime and rinse the extracorporeal circuit and dialyzer with saline solution. Wait until priming is completed.
9. Adjust the treatment parameters according to the prescription and patient's condition. These include blood flow rate, dialysate flow rate, dialysate temperature, sodium and bicarbonate concentrations, ultrafiltration rate, substitution mode and rate, heparin dose and interval, etc.
10. Perform a T2 test to check for air bubbles and leaks in the extracorporeal circuit. The system will automatically stop blood flow and apply positive pressure to detect any air or fluid loss. Wait until the test is completed.
