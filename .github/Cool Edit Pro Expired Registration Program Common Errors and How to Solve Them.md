## Method 1: Modify the Registry
 
One of the reasons why Cool Edit Pro 2.0 may not work on Windows 10 is that it is incompatible with the 64-bit architecture of the operating system. To solve this, you can try modifying the registry to make Cool Edit Pro 2.0 run as a 32-bit application. Here are the steps:

2. Navigate to the following key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers
3. Right-click on an empty space and select New > String Value.

7. Try running Cool Edit Pro 2.0 again and see if it works.

## Method 2: Install sndvol32 /r
 
Another reason why Cool Edit Pro 2.0 may not work on Windows 10 is that it requires sndvol32 /r, which is a mixer program that is not available on Windows 10 by default. To solve this, you can try installing sndvol32 /r from an older version of Windows, such as Windows XP. Here are the steps:

1. Download sndvol32.exe from a trusted source, such as [this website](https://www.dll-files.com/sndvol32.exe.html).
2. Copy sndvol32.exe to C:\Windows\System32 folder.
3. Open the Start menu and type cmd in the search box. Right-click on the Command Prompt app and select Run as administrator.
4. Type cd C:\Windows\System32 and press Enter.
5. Type regsvr32 sndvol32.exe and press Enter.
6. You should see a message saying that sndvol32.exe was registered successfully.
7. Close the Command Prompt and restart your computer.
8. Try running Cool Edit Pro 2.0 again and see if it works.

## Method 3: Use a Different Audio Editing Software
