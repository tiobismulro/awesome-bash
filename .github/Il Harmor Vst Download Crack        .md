- Harmor has two independent parts, A and B, that can be used separately or together. You can switch between them by clicking on the tabs at the top of the interface. You can also blend them using the mix knob or the XY pad.
- Harmor has four main sections: Timbre, Harmonics, FX, and Envelopes. Each section has multiple tabs that contain different parameters and options. You can access them by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the interface.
- Harmor uses additive synthesis, which means that it creates sounds by adding up sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. You can control the shape and spectrum of these sine waves using the Timbre section. You can also import your own samples or images and use them as the source of the sine waves.
- Harmor has a powerful Harmonics section that allows you to manipulate the individual harmonics of the sound. You can use various tools such as filters, phasers, prisms, plucks, unison, and more to create interesting and unique sounds.
- Harmor has a comprehensive FX section that includes distortion, chorus, delay, reverb, compression, EQ, and more. You can apply these effects to each part separately or to both parts together. You can also modulate these effects using the Envelopes section.
- Harmor has a flexible Envelopes section that lets you control the volume, pitch, filter, panning, and other parameters of the sound over time. You can use various shapes and curves to create dynamic and expressive sounds. You can also link these envelopes to other parameters using the modulation matrix.

Harmor is a synthesizer that can do almost anything you want. It is a great tool for creating leads, pads, basses, plucks, drums, effects, and more. You can also use it to resynthesize and process any sound you like. The possibilities are endless with Harmor!
