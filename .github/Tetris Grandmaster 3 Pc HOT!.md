## Using an Emulator
 
An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another system, such as an arcade machine. To play TGM3 on an emulator, you will need two things: the Taito Type X files and the TGM3 ROM. The Taito Type X files are the files that run the arcade system that TGM3 was released on. The TGM3 ROM is the file that contains the game data. You can find both files online with some searching, but we cannot provide any links due to legal reasons.
 
Once you have downloaded both files, you will need to extract them to a folder on your PC. Then, you will need to run the TTXConfig.exe file in the Taito Type X folder to configure your controls and game options. You can use your keyboard or a controller/arcade stick to play the game. You can also change the screen resolution, sound volume, and other settings.
 
After you have configured everything, you can run the game by double-clicking on the Game.exe file in the TGM3 folder. You will see a black screen for a few seconds, then the game will start. You can press F2 to insert coins and F1 to start the game. You can also press F4 to toggle fullscreen mode.
 
## Using a Hacked Version
 
A hacked version is a modified version of the game that runs natively on Windows without an emulator. It has some advantages over the emulator version, such as faster loading times, better compatibility, and easier configuration. However, it may also have some bugs or glitches that are not present in the original version.
